The architecture is little-endian.

i address: from 0x7fffcc061b7e to 0x7fffcc061b7f because it is 2 bytes.
x address: 0x7fffcc061b7d since it is 1 byte.
sn1 address: from 0x7fffcc061b80 to 0x7fffcc061b87 since it is 8 bytes.
sn2 address: from 0x7fffcc061b88 to 0x7fffcc061b8f, same as sn1.
y[] address: from 0x7fffcc061b90 to 0x7fffcc061b97, since it has 2 int of 4 bytes each.
